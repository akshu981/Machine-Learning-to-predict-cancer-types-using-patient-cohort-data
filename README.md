This project leverages machine learning to predict cancer types and mutation statuses using genomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), comprising over 20,000 cancer patients across 33 cancer types. The analysis pipeline includes comprehensive data preprocessing to handle missing values, class imbalances, and feature engineering, followed by model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms. Key preprocessing steps include one-hot and label encoding for categorical variables, imputation of missing values, outlier removal, and standardization to ensure data consistency. Exploratory data analysis revealed important patterns in sequencing strategies, survival metrics, and demographic distributions that informed feature selection and model development.

The best-performing model was XGBoost, achieving an accuracy of 83.83% and F1 score of 81.89% on the test set, significantly outperforming Logistic Regression (36.71% accuracy) and Random Forest (68.50% accuracy). The optimized XGBoost model with hyperparameters demonstrated strong performance across multiple cancer types, particularly excelling at identifying Blood Vessel Tumors, Lymphoid Leukemias, and various Neoplasms with high precision and recall. The model addresses class imbalance through stratified k-fold cross-validation and has potential clinical applications for developing decision-support tools that provide oncologists with predictions of cancer types and mutation statuses, aiding early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.
